# Some of my works on Statistics and R programming

- The main contents in this repo are the homeworks that I have done in US Berkeley W203 course which introducting many different types of quantitative research methods and statistical techniques for analyzing data. 

- The works begin with a focus on measurement, inferential statistics and causal inference using the open-source statistics language, R. Topics in quantitative techniques include: descriptive and inferential statistics, sampling, experimental design, tests of difference, ordinary least squares regression, general linear models.

- In addition to the W203 works, I have collected other live session and materials.
