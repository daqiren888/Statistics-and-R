# Live Session and Homework 

This is the primary repository for instructors to distribute live session and homework materials to students.

- You will be turning in homework, and receiving feedback through [Gradescope](http://gradescope.com/). 
- So that we can time the relase with each section, we will be providing you access to live session and homework solutions in a separate repository
